### YOUR CODE HERE: write at least three functions which solve
### specific tasks by transforming the input x and returning the
### result. Name them according to the task ID as in the three
### examples below. Delete the three examples. The tasks you choose
### must be in the data/training directory, not data/evaluation.

def solve_4258a5f9(x):
    '''
    Light blue squares must be surrounded by purple squares. (Unsure of exact colours, bit colour blind)
    so a grid of: 0 0 0 0 0 must become:  0 1 1 1 0
                  0 0 5 0 0               0 1 5 1 0

    Solve will work by identifying blue squares, which is 5 in the grid.
    Then, the function will put purple squares, 1, around the blue (5) square.
